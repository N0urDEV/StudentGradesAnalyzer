# StudentGradesAnalyzer
a Python script that computes a student's average grade based on three input scores (out of 20) and assigns a performance mention, such as "Excellent," "Very Good," "Good," "Passable," or "Insufficient." It displays the average grade and the assigned mention for the student's performance.
